# My React Starter

This is my personal React boilerplate. I utilize it as a base for projects so I can get something minimal started quickly. I decided to build this to teach myself some things and I encourage everyone to do the same. However, feel free to just use this if you so wish.

## What's Included

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) 16.3
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) with the [Stage 2 preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-2/)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) support
- [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
- A [Development Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) with [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)


## Usage
`git clone git@github.com:itzsaga/my-react-starter.git`  
`npm install` or `yarn`  
`npm start` or `yarn start`

When you're ready to deploy run `npm build` or `yarn build` to get your production ready files output to the `/dist` directory.
